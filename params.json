Using this validator, we aim to create a extension using which we can validate our pages in just one click. No need to hit the url of W3C validator again and again. This extension will be created primarily for Google Chrome. Later on, we will extend it to Mozilla Firefox also. \r\n\r\n## Need of Validator\r\nThere are two primary reasons for developing this validator:  \r\nI) There were no validation extension for Google Chrome as WAT available in IE. There are certain issues with WAT also such as many times it would refuse to open the validator, it works in IE only which is for very obvious reasons have been obsolete.  \r\nII) Developing a extension, would give us more in depth understanding of working of browser and also provide us a better working knowledge of Javascript.\r\n\r\n### Current Status\r\nCurrently, we are facing the problem(kind of roadblock) with W3C validator. It is validating the URL infinitely in a loop again and again, which is causing further issues. I am doing more research into the working of W3C validator to slove this issue. I have come across many solutions such as URL hex encoding, or using a flag to stop the loop. During the research, I have come across this URL, which is very useful ::  \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nCurrently, I am the only soul engaged with this holy task. Hope that in future, many more will or may contribute.\r\n\r\nYou can reach me at poshakajay@gmail.com or www.quora.com/Ajay-Poshak.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
